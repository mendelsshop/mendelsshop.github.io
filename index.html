            <h2 id="title">About me: </h2>
            <p> Hi there I'm Mendel. <br>
                Some of the languages I use and know: Rust, OCaml, C#, Java, Racket, JavaScript, Python, and C.<br>
                I graduated from SUNY Albany in the spring of 2025, with bachelor's in Computer Science.<br>
                I have a interest in programming languages, and have worked with type systems, static analysis, and
                macro
                expanders, among others.<br>
                I mainly like to focus on systems programming, or application development.<br>
                I prefer to use functional style programming languages, but I know and use others.

                        <h3 id="projectdesc"> About:</h3>
                        Have you ever wanted to see how a given function changes over time? That is what
                        git_function_history is
                        for.<br>
                        Uses <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/">Tree Sitter</a> to make it easier to add support
                        for as many languages as possible.<br>
                        <h3 id="projectdesc"> Usage:</h3>
                        It allows you to search in a git repository for all functions with a given name.<br>
                        You can use certain search filters to only look in certain folders or during certain dates among
                        others.<br>
                        After your search finds results you can filter down further by syntactic properties of the
                        function.<br>
                        <br>
                        You can use from the TUI or GUI frontend, and there is also a rust crate, that you can integrate
                        into your
                        own projects.

                    A little prank for the hack3r in your life.<br>
                    It looks like a hacking tool to take down websites, but all it does is edit the users host file.

                    A really simple logger that logs to a file that uses the rust <a id="projectdesc"

                    <h3 id="projectdesc">About:</h3>
                    Get a random piece of art from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.<br>
                    It uses the Metropolitan Museum of Art API.<br>
                    You can filter the art by date, and medium (painting,
                    sculpture, etc) right now.<br>
                    I made this because I couldn't choose which art piece to use for an art history class.

                    A joke Programming Language that combines lots of feature from many different languages into
                    one.<br>
                    Initially based on UMPL.<br>
                    It has racket like syntax, but you can also write c/rust syntax.<br>
                    It has a module and macro system similar to racket's.<br>
                    Functions are auto curried an idea taken from ML/Haskell.

                    A ML based programming language.<br>
                    Started of as a way to learn about type inference.<br>
                    Type system is HM with row types, eventually going to use a full constraint based approach.<br>
                    Has interesting syntax where normally whatever you type is just interpreted as something to
                    print.<br>
                    To actually program you have to quote the program (inverse of most languages).<br>
                    This idea and using ML based syntax made it it bit complicated to parse.

                    The game is P2P, and you can play locally with same idea (the two peers are on the same computer or same local network).

                    I worked on this a research project and as a capstone project with a bunch of other people.<br>
                    I worked on the LLVM compilation backend, including adding a monomporphizer.<br>
                    I fixed and refactored the type and module system.<br>
                    For my capstone I wrote an <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">LSP</a>
