      <p> Hi there I'm Mendel. <br>
        Some of the languages I use and know: Rust, OCaml, Java, Python, and C.<br>
        I am graduating from SUNY Albany in the spring of 2025, with bachelor's in Computer Science.<br>
        I have a interest in programming languages, and have worked with type systems, static analysis, and macro
        expanders, among others.<br>
        I perfer to use functional style programming languages, but I know and use others.

            <h3 id="projectdesc"> About:</h3>
            Have you ever wanted to see how a given function changes over time? That is what git_function_history is
            for.<br>
            <h3 id="projectdesc"> Usage:</h3>
            It allows you to search in a git repo for all functions with a given name.<br>
            You can use certain search filters to only look in certain folders or during certain dates among others.<br>
            After your search finds results you can filter down further by syntatic properties of the function.<br>
            <br>
            You can use from the TUI or GUI frontend, and there is also a rust crate, that you can integrate into your
            own projects.
