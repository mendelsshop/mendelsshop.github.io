            <h2 id="title">About me: </h2>
            <p> Hi there I'm Mendel. <br>
                Some of the languages I use and know: Rust, OCaml, C#, Java, Racket, JavaScript, Python, and C.<br>
                I graduated from SUNY Albany in the spring of 2025, with bachelor's in Computer Science.<br>
                I have a interest in programming languages, and have worked with type systems, static analysis, and
                macro
                expanders, among others.<br>
                I mainly like to focus on systems programming, or application development.<br>
                I prefer to use functional style programming languages, but I know and use others.
            </p>

                        <h3 id="projectdesc"> About:</h3>
                        Have you ever wanted to see how a given function changes over time? That is what
                        git_function_history is
                        for.<br>
                        Uses <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/">Tree Sitter</a> to make it easier to add support
                        for as many languages as possible.<br>
                        <h3 id="projectdesc"> Usage:</h3>
                        It allows you to search in a git repository for all functions with a given name.<br>
                        You can use certain search filters to only look in certain folders or during certain dates among
                        others.<br>
                        After your search finds results you can filter down further by syntactic properties of the
                        function.<br>
                        <br>
                        You can use from the TUI or GUI frontend, and there is also a rust crate, that you can integrate
                        into your
                        own projects.

                    A little prank for the hack3r in your life.<br>
                    It looks like a hacking tool to take down websites, but all it does is edit the users host file.

                    A really simple logger that logs to a file that uses the rust <a id="projectdesc"

                    <h3 id="projectdesc">About:</h3>
                    Get a random piece of art from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.<br>
                    It uses the Metropolitan Museum of Art API.<br>
                    You can filter the art by date, and medium (painting,
                    sculpture, etc) right now.<br>
                    I made this because I couldn't choose which art piece to use for an art history class.

                    A joke Programming Language that combines lots of feature from many different languages into
                    one.<br>
                    Initially based on UMPL.<br>
                    It has racket like syntax, but you can also write c/rust syntax.<br>
                    It has a module and macro system similar to racket's.<br>
                    Functions are auto curried an idea taken from ML/Haskell.

                    A ML based programming language.<br>
                    Started of as a way to learn about type inference.<br>
                    Type system is HM with row types, eventually going to use a full constraint based approach.<br>
                    Has interesting syntax where normally whatever you type is just interpreted as something to
                    print.<br>
                    To actually program you have to quote the program (inverse of most languages).<br>
                    This idea and using ML based syntax made it it bit complicated to parse.

                    Currently whatever is implemented is for local games,<br> but there is plans to have multiplayer

                    I worked on this a research project and as a capstone project with a bunch of other people.<br>
                    I worked on the LLVM compilation backend, including adding a monomporphizer.<br>
                    I fixed and refactored the type and module system.<br>
                    For my capstone I wrote an <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">LSP</a>
